# food_and_drinks_app
Front end SPA app made using only Vanilla Javascript.Router done "by hand" no frameworks or libraries.I did this project in order to get a really good insight 
about how JS works by itself. Data from mealDB and cocktailDB api's.The project has many features , such as pagination , search component,sort by name or price. 
It was a long project and I learned a lot.I used JS modules , compiled and bundled them with Parcel JS.Styles with 
Bootstrap and Sass.Hope you like it !
